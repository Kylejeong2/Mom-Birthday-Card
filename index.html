        <p>Hi Mom, Happy Birthday! Thank you for everything that you do for me and all of the love and support you give me. I really appreciate everything that you do for me and our family. 
            I love you and I hope you have a great birthday and many more birthdays to come. I hope you like this digital birthday card I made. I tried to make it with stuff you liked like dogs and the color green. 
        </p>
        <p>I love you Mom!</p>
